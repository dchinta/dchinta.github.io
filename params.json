I love researching startups and discovering new business models and product ideas. Iâ€™m passionate about data and in all its forms and extracting impactful business insights from it. Here are some personal projects that I worked on recently. [Lending Club graphical analysis](https://rawgit.com/dchinta/dchinta.github.io/master/Lending_Club.html), Titanic Passenger data. I'm still getting my hands dirty with the machine learning here's my first stab at it, [a small image compression algorithm](https://rawgit.com/dchinta/dchinta.github.io/master/SVD_Image.html) I wrote and [learning model](https://rawgit.com/dchinta/dchinta.github.io/master/SVD_Image_Classification.html) that decodes handwritten digits.          I'm currently working on editing OpenStreet Map data for my hometown in India.  \r\n\r\nWhen I'm not on the hunt for outliers, I'm either trying out new recipes or brainstorming articles to write about wedding inspirations for brides-to-be. \r\n  \r\nI can help you get the most horsepower out of your data to gain valuable insights for your business. \r\nLets work together! \r\n\r\n[Email] (mailto:divya.chinta@gmail.com)\r\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dchinta) \r\n[Github](https://www.github.com/dchinta)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
